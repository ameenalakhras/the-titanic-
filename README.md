# the-titanic- is a repository to show how i passed the titanic competetion step by step and the mistakes that i did 
- i did it this way so anyone can see the problems that i fell to to learn from 
so my first notebook was (titanic) then (titanic update ) then (titanic update 2) and finally  (titanic update 3)
- I've added (titanic for kaggle) which is a kernal that i established on kaggle that has a simple way of explaining things for beginners,
you can check it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/amin602/titanic-solution-using-data-analysis) if you would like to.
